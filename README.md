codeset 5ooo frontend
=====================

A frontend for managing dynamic enumerations stored somewhere behind a REST rainbow.

Or frankly speaking an excuse to stretch my AngularJS/Jade/Brunch/Bower/Bootstrap/Coffeescript skills with an inside-joke application.

Codeset is a business case that had a tradition to be implemented over and over again in the flavor of the month in a corporation I was working. So why not once more?

Implemented over node-web-kit-hipster-seed. Fear my moustache and lumberjack beard!
